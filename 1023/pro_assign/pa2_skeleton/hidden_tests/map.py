    Read and parse a game map from a file.

    A map file is a text file where each non-blank character represents a tile in the map.

    A map file may contain the following characters:

    - "." represents an empty tile (Tile.EMPTY).
    - "#" represents a rock tile (Tile.ROCK).
    - "@" represents a bomb tile (Tile.BOMB).
    - "0" represents an empty tile and indicates the initial position of the tank for player 1.
    - "1" represents an empty tile and indicates the initial position of the tank for player 2.

    Each line in the file represents a row in the map and each non-blank character in the lines represents a tile.
    The number of non-space characters in the first line indicates the number of columns in the map.
    The number of lines in the file indicates the number of rows in the map.

    For example, the following is a valid map file:

    ```
    0 . .
    . # .
    . . 1
    ```

    The above map file represents a 3x3 map with the initial positions of tank 1 and tank 2, on the top-left and
    bottom-right corners, respectively. There is 1 rock tile in the center of the map with 8 empty tiles
    surrounding it.
